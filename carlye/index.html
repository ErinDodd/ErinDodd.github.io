		<h2 class="getToKnow"> Get to know me.</h2>
				<p>After years of training in traditional Irish dance and ballet, I graduated from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology. After graduation, I realized pursed a career as a professional dancer, dancing in Vancouver, BC and Seattle, WA. 
				In 2012 I founded The Seattle Irish Dance Company, and haven’t looked back. 
				Working as a freelance artist has afforded me the opportunities to experience many jobs I never would have otherwise: a park ranger, kayak guide, camp counselor, restaurant manager and preschool teacher–all experiences that have added to my desire to keep writing about the adventures life presents.</p>
